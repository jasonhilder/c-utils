# C Utils

These are a bunch of personal C utility libraries, to reduce re-writing common code in C projects. These are created as I need them as I continue learning C, I try to make them effecient both in terms of speed and memory. However I am very new to C and am likely doing things wrong in some cases.

The goal being that this grows and gets altered to a state where I can comfortably reach for these when needed and know that it is doing what it should as well as not leaking memory all over.

* Note this is a very new project of mine and will be changing constantly in code and this readme *

Below is a list of the current libraries:

## String

Common functions to create and manipulate strings 

```
@todo
```

## Vector

Dynamic array like structure with add, remove, includes etc

```
@todo
```
